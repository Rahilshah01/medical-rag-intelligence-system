      "This is a consultation for a 23-year-old white female presenting with a complaint of allergies, specifically Allergic Rhinitis. She reports her allergies are worse now than when she lived in Seattle. She has previously tried Claritin and Zyrtec, which were effective for a short period before losing effectiveness. She has also used Allegra, which she started using again two weeks ago but is not finding very effective. She has used over-the-counter nasal sprays but no prescription ones. She has asthma, but it does not require daily medication and she does not believe it is currently flaring up. Her current medications are Ortho Tri-Cyclen and Allegra. She has no known medicine allergies. Objectively, her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate, and her nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen with clear drainage. Her tympanic membranes (TMs) were clear, and her neck was supple. Her weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure was 124/78.\n"
